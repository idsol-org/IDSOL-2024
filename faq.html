IDSOL has since reached over 10,000 students worldwide and catapulted many former blockchain olympians to top academic programmes and careers.</p><p>The IDSOL Finals is an annual event that brings hundreds of innovative students and professionals together. The mixing produces magical moments of inspiration and discussion, leading to further collaboration and possibly new projects and ventures.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><h4 class="question">What is blockchain technology?</h4><div class="answer"><p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed, digital ledger that enables trust and transparent peer-to-peer transactions. Blockchain's debut with Bitcoin captured the imagination of the world, with many looking to a future of decentralized finance and others at a future of decentralized computing. IDSOL invites students to widen their worldview to explore how blockchain can be used as the backbone of a new digital era.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><h4 class="question">What are blockchain solutions?</h4><div class="answer"><p>A blockchain-enabled solution leverages blockchain as a technology as well as other technologies and cryptographies to provide a single truth for an ecosystem of stakeholders that may otherwise not be able to cooperate and collaborate: a zero-trust environment. Blockchain solutions have quietly taken over many corners of the internet in the form of industry-specific or government-led digital economic infrastructures.</p><p>Today, the all-encompassing term&nbsp;<strong>web3</strong>&nbsp;(not to be confused with web 3.0) brings blockchain solutions under one umbrella, and indeed, blockchain is an important part of a web3 solution but not the main nor the biggest part.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><h4 class="question">What is careers in blockchain and web3?</h4><p>There are a variety of careers available in the field of blockchain technology. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>Blockchain Developer: involves designing, developing, and implementing blockchain-based solutions; may include writing code, creating smart contracts, and integrating blockchain technology with other systems.</li><li>Blockchain Architect: responsible for designing the overall structure and functionality of a blockchain system; involves understanding the technical requirements of the project and working with other stakeholders to ensure that the architecture meets their needs.</li><li>Blockchain Business Analyst: involves analyzing business requirements and identifying opportunities for blockchain-based solutions; must have a deep understanding of both blockchain technology and the industry in which they are working.</li><li>Blockchain Project Manager: involves overseeing the development and implementation of blockchain-based projects; must be able to manage multiple stakeholders and ensure that the project is delivered on time and within budget.</li><li>Blockchain Marketing and Communications Specialist: involves promoting the benefits of blockchain technology to potential clients and stakeholders; must be able to translate technical concepts into language that is accessible to a non-technical audience.</li></ul><div class="answer"><p>These are just a few examples of the many careers available in the blockchain industry. As blockchain technology continues to grow and evolve, there will likely be even more opportunities for individuals with specialized skills and knowledge in this field.</p></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="page-footer dark"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-sm-9 col-9 col-lg-9 col-xl-9 xol-xxl-9"><h5>International Data Science Olympiad (IDSOL)</h5><p style="color: white;">The International Data Science Olympiad (IDSOL) invites students from all over the world to submit proposals to solve real-world challenges with data science as presentations and prototypes showcased to judges from academic, industry, and government backgrounds.</p></div><div class="col-sm-3 col-3 col-lg-3 col-xl-3 col-xxl-3"><h5>Quick Links</h5><ul><li><a href="rules.html">IDSOL 2024 Rules</a></li><li><a href="faq.html">IDSOL 2024 FAQ</a></li><li><a href="contact.html">Contact IDSOL 2024</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer-copyright"><p>© 2020-2024 International Data Science Olympiad (MTÜ).
